# hello-world

My name is Yutaka Jitsumatsu. I am an associate professor in Kyushu university, Japan. 
I am interested in communication theory, information theory, and nonlinear sciences. 

I want to put progams that I have made for my researches in GitHub so that anyone can access to my source file.
